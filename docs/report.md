## Background
#### What is Accident About?

- The objective of this project is to implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a data-driven technique used in marketing and customer analytics to segment a customer base based on their transactional behavior.
  - It involves analyzing three key aspects of customer interactions with a business:
    1. Recency (R): This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase or engaged with your business. It typically involves calculating the time elapsed since the customer's last transaction.
    2. Frequency (F): Frequency indicates how often a customer makes purchases or interacts with your business. It is usually calculated as the total number of transactions within a specified time frame.
    3. Monetary (M): Monetary value represents the total amount of money a customer has spent on your products or services over a given period.

- **Why does it matter?**
    - RFM analysis is a data-driven approach that helps businesses make informed decisions based on actual customer behavior. It minimizes guesswork and intuition, allowing organizations to rely on evidence-based strategie.
    - RFM analysis enables businesses to understand their customers better by categorizing them into distinct segments based on their transactional behavior. This allows for personalized marketing strategies tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each segment.
    - Segment-specific marketing campaigns can be more effective than generic campaigns. RFM analysis helps businesses design and execute campaigns that resonate with each segment, leading to higher response rates and conversion rates.

- **What are your research questions?**
    - What are the distinct customer segments based on their transactional behavior? How can we categorize customers into high-value, low-value, loyal, and at-risk segments?
    - Are there customer segments with growth potential that have been underutilized?
    - What complementary products can be recommended to customers based on their purchase history?
    - Which customer segments have the highest retention rates?
